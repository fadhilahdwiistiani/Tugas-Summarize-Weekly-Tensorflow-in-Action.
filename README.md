# 🧠 About This Book
TensorFlow in Action is an end-to-end guide to deep learning with TensorFlow.  
It focuses not only on model building, but also on data pipelines, monitoring, and deployment — the things that truly matter in real-world ML systems.

This book is ideal for:
- 🎓 Students learning ML & AI
- 📊 Data Scientists
- 🧑‍💻 Machine Learning Engineers

---

# 🔁 The Big Picture
The book walks through the **complete machine learning lifecycle**:
Data → Model → Training → Evaluation → Monitoring → Deployment


> 💡 Machine Learning is a system — not just a model.
